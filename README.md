A shopping cart project completed for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-shopping-cart). 

This project is a simple multi-page shopping site mock-up built with React and React-Router-DOM.

[Live Demo](https://brenton-j-andrews.github.io/shopping-cart/)

Site icons, images and design sourced from [Seattle Coffee Gear](https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/)

TODO list for project completion:
1. Add React interaction tests / unit testing.
2. Add product filters for the shopping page and styling for the filter menu.
3. Add pages for each individual product -> dynamic URL building!
